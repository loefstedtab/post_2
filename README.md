This is the accompanying notebook, data and charts for my second blog post.

The goal of this post was to examine the relationship between year to year statistics for goalies in the NHL as well as their individual cap hit. 
The statistics that I focused on were SV% and GSAA. I chose these two because while there is adjusted SV%, it is already a quality statistic in itself. I also chose GSAA because it allowed me to compare each goalie to the average very easily, which I thought would be helpful when examining a player's cap hit. 

Lessons learned:
1. I need to work on becoming more organized with my research. I think that before I start my next post I will sit down and try and create a sort of roadmap for how I believe my workflow should go. You can see from this code that it is pretty messy and does not really follow any logical path. This is because I really only had a vague idea of where I was going with my analysis and I certainly did not have a good idea of how I would get there. This resulted in this post taking much much longer than it should have. So lesson number one is the plan more thoroughly.
2. Lesson two ties in with lesson one. I need to do a better job of developing a clear hypothesis before I start any research. Having this to guide my thought process will give me a direction to steer toward and hopefully help things move in a more rational pattern. I think this post and my first post were examples of me kind of knowing the answer to my question already and then finding ways to demonstrate that answer. Moving forward, even if I create a hypothesis that is disproven, that is fine, because I think it will force me to become a better researcher as well as teaching me more about the subject.
3. Work smarter, not harder. A quick look at my code and you will see that it is not exactly very neat. There is a lot of code that could be refactored and work that I repeat through individual blocks of code that probably could have been done in a loop or in a much cleaner fashion. That will be a goal for next time.

Overall, I hope that you enjoy the post, and find the analysis at least a little interesting. As always I am very much open to constructive criticism and always looking for ways to improve!
